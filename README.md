# Certificate Validation Using Blockchain

## 📜 Overview

This project implements a blockchain-based certificate validation system designed to prevent certificate forgery and simplify the verification process. It allows institutions to issue certificates that are securely recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency, immutability, and easy public verification.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 **Tamper-Proof Records:** Certificates stored on the blockchain cannot be altered or deleted.
- 🌐 **Decentralized Verification:** Anyone can verify a certificate without contacting the issuing authority.
- ⚡ **Smart Contract Automation:** Certificates are issued and validated using smart contracts.
- 📄 **Public Ledger:** All data is traceable and transparent on the blockchain.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Blockchain Platform:** Ethereum
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Blockchain Interaction:** Web3.js
- **Backend (Optional):** Node.js / Python (Flask/Django)
- **Development Environment:** Remix IDE / Truffle / Ganache
